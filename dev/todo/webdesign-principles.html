    | Our Principles of Webdesign |
    +-----------------------------+
  </pre>
  
  <h2>## The purpose of a website</h2>
  
  <p>I would describe a website as an individual online platform for expression.* And the idea of a webdesign begins with the condition, that you think that you have something to express, that you consider worth expressing. If you wouldn't consider it worth expressing, there'd be no need for a platform serving that cause.</p>
  
  <p>* Because why would you want to have a page on the web? You want a page because you want to express (show/say/write/...) something on it. Something that you have to say, in spoken, written words or songs, something that you want to show, in artworks, photos, films or whatever. It is reasonable to use the (world wide) web to do this being an international means of communication, with world wide accesibility. You have a higher chance of getting people to look at your stuff, if that stuff is online too -> It just makes sense to create a website, if you have something to express.</p>
  
  <p>So at first I am aware of (feeling, knowing, sensing, imagining, ...) what it is that I want to express, thereby knowing why I want to design a website. And thus, the next question arises: How to express it? Which translates to: How do I design a website in order to present my idea in the most effective way?</p>
  
  <p>To answer that question, we may first ask if and why 'expressing it effectively' may be a suitable criterion. What it means to express your ideas, thoughts, your vision, your art or whatever it is in the 'most effective way', depends on what you want it to be effective in. You may consider it effective in that it uses the technology most effectively; thereby it would be highly ineffective to use complex designs if the content would had been delivered much faster and more directly, when you'd had just delivered a static website with pure text.</p>
  
  <p>But how could it be effective to render your website in pure text, if what you want is visual expression, if, for instance, you want to use your website as a digital exhibition of your art?</p>
    
  <p>Another one may consider it effective to get as much attention as possible with what he is about to express and so he may not care for other kinds of effectiveness, because they have nothing to do with the effect he's striving for.</p>
    
  <p>What is most effective depends both on what you want to express and what you want to achieve by that expression. What is a good design for some specific cause, is a bad one for another. You can't judge a design irregardless of what it is supposed to serve.</p>
    
  <p>Another question arises: Is the webdesign supposed to serve the art you want to express, which serves itself? Or is the art you want to express supposed to serve a cause other than itself? The webdesign is a means of expression; but it also can be a means of expression of a means of expression. For instance: You want to express some truth about yourself (which, in my philosophy, equals beauty) by making pottery. And you want a webdesign that serves just one cause: Presenting your craftwork. Everything in the design that distracts from your craftwork will thereby be ineffective bloat. And the more the design distracts from what it was supposed to present, the less it serves its cause -> this is bad design. The best design in this case is the one which recedes in the background of its content.</p>
  
  
  <p>But there may be other cases, in which the design is not just a maidservant of a higher cause, but expressing something in itself, beyond, in accordance with, or in opposition to the content of your platform. You may be a philosopher, writing about autonomy, individuality and independence on your webpage, while your generic webdesign from a commercial corporate platform that you use tells a metastory of heteronomy, uniformity and dependence, thus being in opposition to the content.</p>
  
  
  <h2>## Contradictions of the Revolt</h2>
  
  <p>That doesn't mean that such a discrepancy would be immoral. I don't care for morality. In the example above it may mean that the conditions of the platform hurt the expression. But there are other cases, where you may be forced to accept contradictions between what you want to express and how you do it, on which platform, by which means.</p>
  
  <p>For example: You may be convinced of primitivism, you think the web sucks and you want to overcome it. It would be 'consequent', it may seem to serve your integrity, to not use what you want to overcome, to boycott what you don't want to exist, to live without the web.</p> 
  
  <p>But you also could just decide to use the web to promote your anti-web ideas. You can use the very ressource that you want to destroy to propagate the destruction of itself. You critizise it from within and through the very means you want to overcome. That wouldn't be unreasonable to do. It would be just as using an asocial platform like instagram in order to inform and convince people to abandon the platform or to use it less.</p>
  
  <p>It is reasonable to decide that you'll need to dive into the water in order to safe those drowning there. It is reasonable to enter the burning house you do not want to be in, in order to rescue those about to burn.</p> 
  
  <p>Sure, you would be safer if you wouldn't do so. It would be less of a risk. But it may be the necessary price to pay for change. It may be the utmost compromise to make in order to overcome the radical escapism of those feeling miserable, because they refuse the very means by which they could change what causes their suffering, which is what happened to myself.</p>
  
  
  
  
  <p>I can not recall how many times I have redesigned this website (phoenixtales.de), since the first design in 2018. But it should be something between 5 and 7 times.</p>
  
  <p>If you follow our work since the very beginning but can't remember that many different versions of the website: In some cases, a design was only in use for one or two days before I decided to redo it from scratch because it seemed too complicated. Other than that, I have learned to webdesign in that very process and through that need (or desire) to have something to represent our project and our team.</p>
  
  <p>And when I learned anything by doing so, then that there is always a tendency for fancier designs. You increase your skills and then you think, that a fancier webpage will be able to represent the project in some more spectacular kind of way; and so you go for it, until you realise how complicated it has become and how much work it will be to do the mobile optimisation.<br>
  And when you are honest to yourself and look at that complexity from within, that complexity you invented in your pursuit of beauty, you realise how ugly it has become thereby. And in the end, I'll always ended up remembering myself to simplify.</p>
  
  <p>I had a few principles, which I insisted on from the very start of the project: I would not accept any javascript, nor cookies and bloat like that. For that aspect alone our design was already quite different than most modern websites, but it wasn't yet where I wanted it to be and I couldn't stop to revisit the design every once in a while to overhaul it completely.</p>
  
  <p>What was I going for? All my redesigns so far were attempts to find a better balance between my desire to have an artsy appearance and simple(r) code. And I was fascinated by the simplicity of early ANSI and ASCII artworks, which I came in contact with through my experiments with Linux. In the linux culture, this kind of Art still seems to be a thing, but it is almost completely extinct in <a href="https://suckless.org/sucks/web/">the modern web, which sucks</a>. And my design was supposed to suck less.</p>
  
  <p>So I experimented with some simple ASCII art done by hand and added it to our website, as you still can see in <a href="https://media.gothicarchive.org/img/header.png">the hover logo of the Gothic Archive</a>. At the same time I had began to design our new Phoenix Game page (https://phoenixthegame.com), which originally was just a subpage of phoenixtales.de, as was the Gothic Archive before I bought a new domain for it and ere Avallach helped me transfering it to Git.</p>
  
  <p>The style of presentation that I had chosen, the simplicity and minimalistic approach that I had taken both with our team page as well as with the Gothic Archive, was a central factor for Avallach and maybe one of the decisive motivations for him to join us. Because we share this fascination. The fascination for simplicity, for minimalism, and as Avallach calls it, for this 'brutalist retro' feeling. We turned out to be very like-minded in this regard, which is rare.</p>
  
  <p>And thus, when I came up with once another overhaul of phoenixtales.de, because the last one didn't seem easy enough and didn't work correctly on mobile, he uttered some critique that hit me hard. Our discussion went like this:</p>
  
  
  <blockquote>Avallach: I'd prefer to limit the amount of visual effects and stick to the more "brutalist" style that we discussed long ago.
  Mostly text and ASCII art, not so many changing pictures.
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>With 'changing pictures' he was referring to our PhoenixTales logo and the logos of our projects. Originally I had included an effect via css, showing the red triangle inside our NYX logo only when hovering over it with the mouse. Something that Oliver always reminded me to put back into the page when I decided to remove it for reasons of simplicity, because it seemed cool.</p>
  
  <p>I replied with this:</p>
  
  <blockquote>Flosha: While I agree that only ASCII Art is cool, when testing it I found that having the ASCII logos next to the Phoenix Logo and Sign, does look less harmonic (because of this difference in style) than when using only the graphical logos. It would look cool if the PhoenixTales logo and sign would be ASCII art too. That would look very minimalistic and simple. And I have thought about that often. But in my opinion it does not make sense to do that, because when we have such a graphical logo that is supposed to represent us, where should it be displayed if not on the PhoenixTales team page?</blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>Avallach: I don't have particular ideas. Let's keep it as it is until better inspiration comes. I just liked the brutalist retro feel of your original designs. Now we're back to the future and mainstream.</blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>Flosha: My original designs did not include ASCII Art either. That was something I came up with later. But I wouldn't agree that it is that mainstream.</blockquote>
  
  <p>After which he showed me my own design and wrote:</p>
  
  <img src="ascii/latestredesign.png">
  
  <blockquote>Avallach: This? C'mon, this is not minimalism.</blockquote>
  
  <p>That hit me. Not minimal enough! From someone I knew that he understood the meaning of the word.</p>
  
  <blockquote>Flosha: I also would like to see an even more minimal approach, but <em>if</em> we go really minimal with ASCII (or ANSI) art, then I say that the <strong>whole</strong> page should be free of images and it should be completely in that style and not just the project logos while the rest is graphical. It doesnt fit otherwise. Either full minimal (and retro) or like now.</blockquote>
  
  <p>One day later:</p>
  
  <blockquote>Flosha: Your "not minimalist enough" critique made me crazy. Therefore...</blockquote>
  
  <img src="ascii/latestredesign2.png">

  <blockquote>Avallach: I think this style is not good for a mod/game page because people expect these to be media-heavy. But for a dev team site it's great. We're the tech guys working behind the scenes after all.</blockquote>
